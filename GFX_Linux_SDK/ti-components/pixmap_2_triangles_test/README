Build steps
=================
1.Update the toolchain(cross-compiler toolchain path), kernel, target NFS, graphics SDK & cmem installation paths in rules.make as on your machine.

2.Issue make clean.

3.Issue make

4.Issue sudo make install if you want to directly install onto the NFS path that you gave in rules.make or you can copy the sampleTwoTriangles executable created in the current directory to required NFS path on target.

Execution steps
===============
1.Ensure graphics SDK is built & installed with FBDEV=no command line option.

2.Boot up the EVM.

3.Insert&initialize the graphics SDK KM modules. This is done as part of omap-demo script. Hence ensure that omap-demo script is run and the graphics drivers(pvrsrvkm.ko, omaplfb.ko) have been inserted, initialized successfully.

4.Insmod cmem.ko that you would have built.

5.Run attached sample app as ./sampleTwoTriangles 2 800 600

When you run the sample app as above & press ctrl-c, you will get the output -pixmap.raw file generated in the same directory from where you ran the app.
This can be viewed with any image viewer(For example IrfanView) that supports viewing raw RGB files. 
Use the setting of 800x600 and 32 bpp while viewing the pixmap.raw file generated when using the above command (./sampleTwoTriangles 2 800 600).
